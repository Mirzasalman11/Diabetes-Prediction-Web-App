# Diabetes Prediction Web App

This Streamlit web application predicts whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on certain health-related features. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Model

- **Model Type**: Logistic Regression
- **Model File**: model.joblib

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: Diabetes dataset
- **Data Source**: [Link to the dataset on Git]
- The dataset contains the following attributes:
  - Feature columns (8): Numerical values representing various health-related features.
  - Target column: Binary variable (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes).

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.
- **main.py**: Streamlit web application for making diabetes predictions.
- **model.joblib**: Pre-trained logistic regression model for diabetes prediction.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd diabetes-prediction-web-app

## Usage
-Clone this repository to your local machine.

-Ensure you have the pre-trained logistic regression model ('model.joblib') in the same directory as the script ('main.py').

-Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

-Run the Streamlit web application:`streamlit run main.py`

-Enter the required health-related features in the web interface to get predictions.
## Model Training
The project uses a logistic regression model to classify individuals into two classes: diabetes and no diabetes. The pre-trained model is saved as 'model.joblib'.

## Results
The web application provides predictions for diabetes based on the input features. The performance of the model may vary depending on the dataset used.

## Future Improvements
There are several ways to improve the model and the web application:

-Explore more advanced machine learning techniques.

-Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.

-Gather more labeled data for improved accuracy.
